# Hack Computer (Nand2Tetris)

This repository contains my implementation of the Hack computer, built as part of the Nand2Tetris course. The project involves designing a computer from first principles, including logic gates, the CPU, memory, an assembler, and a virtual machine.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

- **01-LogicGates** — Basic logic gates.  
- **02-ALU** — Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).  
- **03-Memory** — Memory modules (RAM, Register, etc.).
- **04-CPU** — Central Processing Unit (CPU).  
- **05-Assembler** — Converts Hack assembly to machine code.  
- **06-VMTranslator** — Translates VM code to Hack assembly.  
- **07-OperatingSystem** — A basic operating system for the Hack computer.
